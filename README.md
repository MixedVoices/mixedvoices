# MixedVoices üéôÔ∏è

[MixedVoices](https://www.mixedvoices.xyz) is a analytics and evaluation tool for voice agents. Track, visualize, and optimize agent performance through conversation analysis, call quality metrics and call flow charts. Run simulations to test the agent before pushing to production.

## Features

### Core Capabilities
- üåê **Effortless Integration**: Python API designed for quick and seamless integration, ensuring developers can get started in minutes
- üñ•Ô∏è **Interactive Dashboard**: User-friendly interface for all operations
- üìä **Call Flow Analysis**: Interactive flowcharts showing conversation paths, patterns and success rates
- üîÑ **Version Control**: Track and compare agent behavior across different iterations
- üéØ **ML Performance Metrics**: Track hallucinations, call scheduling, conciseness, and empathy scores
- üì± **Call Quality Analysis**: Monitor interruptions, latency, signal-to-noise ratio, and words per minute
- üß™ **Agent Evaluation**: Test and validate agent performance through simulations and stress testing

## Installation

```bash
pip install mixedvoices
```

### Prerequisites
1. Python 3.8 or higher
2. OpenAI API key (set in your environment variables)

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key'
```

# Quick Start

## Analytics
### Using Python API to analyze recordings
```python
import mixedvoices as mv
project = mv.create_project("receptionist") # Create a new project
project = mv.load_project("receptionist") # or load existing project

version = project.create_version("v1", prompt="You are a ...") # Create a version
version = project.load_version("v1") # or load existing version

# Analyze call, this is blocking, takes a few seconds
version.add_recording("path/to/call.wav") 

# non blocking mode in a separate thread, instantaneous
version.add_recording("path/to/call.wav", blocking=False) 

```

## Evaluation
### Evaluate custom agent
```python
import mixedvoices as mv

# inherits from `BaseAgent`. Must implement respond and starts_conversation
class ReceptionAgent(mv.BaseAgent):
    def __init__(self):
        self.assistant = ReceptionistAssistant(model="gpt-4o")

    def respond(self, input_text: str) -> Tuple[str, bool]:
        response = self.assistant.get_assistant_response(input_text)
        has_conversation_ended = check_conversation_ended(response)
        return response, has_conversation_ended

    @property
    def starts_conversation(self):
        return True


project = mv.load_project("receptionist")
version = project.load_version("v1")
evaluator = version.create_evaluator()
evaluator.run(ReceptionAgent) # can specify which metrics to measure
```

### Evaluate Bland AI Agent
```python
import mixedvoices as mv
project = mv.load_project("receptionist")
version = project.load_version("v1")
evaluator = version.create_evaluator()
evaluator.run(mv.BlandAgent, auth_token="", pathway_id="", start_node_id="") 
```

## Using Dashboard
Launch the interactive dashboard from the Command Line:
```bash
mixedvoices
```

## Development Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MixedVoices/MixedVoices.git
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```
